    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><b>Species: </b>Cotton Bird Pok√©mon</p>
    <p><b>Type: </b>Normal, Flying</p>

        During a battle, you'll catch me using my <b>Natural Cure</b> ability. 
        I sometimes whip out <b>Cloud Nine</b> too (but keep it on the dl cause that's my hidden ability).
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm just relaxing though, I love to clean things using my fluffy wings, 
        and I also enjoy landing on people's heads and pretending to be a fluffy cotton hat.

        I'm currently working towards reaching level 35 so that I can evolve into Altaria.
